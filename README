A Brief Overview of the Solution:

1.	Solution is designed using Cucumber BDD framework with Serenity Reporting in JAVA.
2.	Project is a Maven and dependencies are defined in pom.xml
3.	Tests are written using Cucumber Feature file in Gherking BDD format with the respective Step Definitions
4.	Framework is designed in the Page Object Model 
5.	Comments have been added to the code for easy understanding
6.	Test runs on Chrome Browser and driver version is 88
7.	This framework can also run in parallel threads by increasing the Test Runner
To Run the tests:

Repository URL - https://github.com/mbragadeesh/pwc-test.git
1.	Clone the Repository to your local Folder.
2.	Using Command Prompt, navigate to the pwc-test folder where POM.xml is located
3.	Run mvn clean â€“ to clean result target directory, followed by mvn install (Maven should be configured already in the system and added to environment variables)
4.	Above Step 3, will take 5 - 7 mins, to download the dependencies defined in POM.xml and then test will run. This happens only for the first initial time
5.	Serenity BDD HTML report will be generated after the test execution with the screenshots and can be in pwc-test/target/site/index.html
6.	Open the index.html in Google Chrome, to see the BDD Cucumber Reporting
